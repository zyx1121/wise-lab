description: A FastAPI-based REST API service for tracking Apple Find My Items location information, including AirTag, AirPods, and other Find My Items.
---

## Project Background

Apple does not provide an official Find My API interface, primarily due to the following considerations:

- Security: Prevent malicious programs from accessing location information
- Ecosystem: Maintain exclusive connections between Apple devices
- Privacy Protection: Ensure confidentiality of user location data

## Solution

This project implements Find My functionality extension through:

1. Direct reading of Find My cache files in macOS system:

```bash
~/Library/Caches/com.apple.findmy.fmipcore/Items.data
```

2. Converting cache data into standardized API format

3. Providing cross-platform access capability through HTTP protocol

<Callout type="warn">
  System Requirements: Only supports macOS 14.3.1 or earlier versions <br />
  Access Permissions: Requires local file system read permissions <br />
  Update Frequency: Depends on system cache update cycle
</Callout>

## Environment Requirements

- `Poetry`: Python dependency management tool
- macOS system (14.3.1 or earlier)
- Find My cache file access permissions

## Quick Start

1. Clone the project:

```bash
